# Air-Quality-Forecasting-Using-Machine-learning



â€¢ I led an Air Quality Forecasting project using Python's pandas, numpy , and Prophet library. I processed the data, handled missing values, and converted date-time columns. Employing Prophet, I trained models and generated forecasts. This project showcased my skills in data preprocessing, time series forecasting, visualization, and collaboration, demonstrating my ability to derive insights and tackle environmental challenges.
